--Capital first letter part of every constructor?

SUCCESSFULLY FOLLOWED HIS CODE IN DIGITALPAL.JS

fetch(url)  =========> grabs/fetches url (WHAT IS A PROMISE IN A FETCH?? )
.then (() => { }) RESOLVE FUNCTION
.catch (() => { }) REJECT FUNCTION 

BUILDING PROMISES USING CONSTRUCTORS

new Promise((res, rej) => {
    res(anything)
    rej(new Error())
})

WHAT IS isNaN and !isNaN????????????????

STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND PARSEINT

const greeting = require('../greeting.js) ======>Was is Das?

# **Instructions for Class Activity 1**
* Remember Tamagotchis? They were those little toys that contained "digital pets" which you could feed, pet, play with, and care for. Kind of like Furbies but a whole lot less terrifying. Over the next thirty minutes or so, you are going to create your own basic Tamagotchi clone using constructors.
* Create a constructor called "DigitalPal" which will create six properties and 10 methods...
  * The first property is "hungry" and it initially starts out as false
  * The second property is "sleepy" and it initially starts out as false
  * The third property is "bored" and it initially starts out as true
  * The fourth property is "age" and it initially starts out at 0
	* the fifth property is "outside" and is initially set to false
	* the sixth property is "houseCondition" and is initially set to 100... But not for long...
	- - - 
	* The first method is "feed()" - If hungry is true, print "That was yummy!", set hungry to false, and then set sleepy to true. If hungry is false, print "No thanks! I'm full."
	* The second method is "sleep()" - If sleepy is true, print `Zzzzzzzz`, set sleepy to false, then set bored to true, and then run increaseAge(). If sleepy is false, print "No way! I'm not tired."
	* The third method is "play()" - If bored is true, print "Yay! Let's play!", set bored to false, and then set hungry to true. If bored is false, print "Not right now. Later?"
	* The fourth method is "increaseAge()" - This method is called by the sleep() method when the DigitalPal goes to sleep and increases the DigitalPal's age by one while also printing "Happy Birthday to me! I am "+age+" old!"
	* The fifth method is "bark()" - Prints out "Woof! Woof!" when run
	* the sixth method is "goOutside()" - If outside is false, prints "Yay! I love the outdoors!", sets outside to true, and runs bark(). If outside is true, prints "We're already outside though..."
	* the seventh method is "goInside()" - If outside is true, prints "Do we have to? Fine..." and sets outside to false. If outside is false, prints "I'm already inside..."
  * the eighth method is "meow()" - prints out "Meow! Meow!" when run
  * the ninth method is "destroyFurniture()" - Decreases houseCondition by 10 and prints "MUAHAHAHAHA! TAKE THAT FURNITURE!" to the screen. Also sets bored to false and sleepy to true. If houseCondition is equal to 0, then this should not run anymore.
  * the tenth method is "buyNewFurniture()" - Increases houseCondition by 50 and prints "Are you sure about that?" to the screen.
* Create a variable named "dog" that is set to a new DigitalPal
* Make a second variable named "cat" that is set to a new DigitalPal
* Play around with your newly created digital pets for a bit and see what else you could add in order to make them even more exciting!
